# React jvectormap - Custom maps

## About

Forked from https://github.com/kadoshms/react-jvectormap

Removed maps that are not of use for my purposes.

Added Cyprus to the Europe map.

## Supported [maps]

* world_mill
* europe_mill (with Cyprus)

## Editing maps source

In `etc/eu_with_cyprus`, there is a map that has been saved, edited in Inkscape. This map can serve as a base for manual editing.

Once a country is saved, the d/path parameter should be placed manually into `src/lib/maps/europe_mill.js`;
